# gcMECM: Graphical Clustering of Mutual Exclusivity of Cancer Mutations to identify sub-biological functions from pathways

The package combines graph clustering, mutation association, and gene interaction 
by the mutually exclusively mutated gene sub-networks to identify sub-biological functions from 
pathways. The sub-networks reveal 
crucial genes in the canonical pathway and discover new cancer-relevant genes and relative biological 
functions, which could used to build better prediction models of clinical response and survival. 
gcMECM also provides informative visualization functionality of mutual exclusivity and network.

# Introduction

Mutation and pathway data
The mis-sense mutation and clinical outcome datasets for LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma) and BRCA (Breast invasive carcinoma) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were obtained from The NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov, version 6). RAS pathway v2.0 is obtained from NCI Ras Initiative  (https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/ras/ras-central/blog/2015/ras-pathway-v2). The pathway structure and gene coordinates were created manually for the visualization. KEGG pathway images and gene relationships were from KEGG database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html).
