# gcMECM: Graphical Clustering of Mutual Exclusivity of Cancer Mutations to identify sub-biological functions from pathways

The package combines graph clustering, mutation association, and gene interaction 
by the mutually exclusively mutated gene sub-networks to identify sub-biological functions from 
pathways. The sub-networks reveal 
crucial genes in the canonical pathway and discover new cancer-relevant genes and relative biological 
functions, which could used to build better prediction models of clinical response and survival. 
gcMECM also provides informative visualization functionality of mutual exclusivity and network.
